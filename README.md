# Airplane

In this Airplane program, there is a text file of 76 names, which are later converted to Passenger objects, but only 50 can fit on a plane. The code selects the first 50 people on the list and adds it to a 2D array which is used to display the airplane seating chart. From there, the user has the option to 1) add passenger, 2) remove passenger, 3) clear a column and replace passengers with people on the waiting list, 4) display seating chart, 5) display waiting list, or 6) quit . If the user selects 1, a new Passenger object is created and added to the waiting list based on the inputted name, if the user selects 2, a passenger is removed and replaced with the first person on the waiting list, and selecting 3 does this to an entire column. The rest of the options are self explanatory. In order to read the text file, I used the BUfferReader class to read through each of line and add each Passenger to a list of Passengers. At the very end, when the user selects 6 (quit), the final seating chart and watilst are displayed.
